# Benefits for Subcontractors in the Philippines

**Purpose**

Over time, as we have established a significant presence of team members in the Philippines, we have progressively enhanced our benefits to better cater to their needs and provide comprehensive assistance.

**Scope**

This section details the benefits specifically designed for subcontractors residing in the Philippines. Our objective is to improve this in the future, but at the moment, this represents what we can provide.


As [subcontractors](https://countable-web.github.io/ops/peopleops/SUBCONTRACTOR_AGREEMENT/#term) are not classified as employees, they do not receive the same benefits that employees in the Philippines enjoy.  Subcontractors operating in the Philippines can reap the benefits outlined below.
