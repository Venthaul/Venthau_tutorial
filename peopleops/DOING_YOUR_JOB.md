# Doing Your Job

**Purpose**

Describing the processes and norms of getting our jobs done at
Countable. Make sure to check out our [Onboarding Guide](ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md) first!

**Scope**

Covers our team management platform Eightmeters, workflow checklists,
remote work basics, professional conduct, setting up your desk,
expenses, and a subcontractor's guide.

## Using Eightmeters

At Countable, we built [Eightmeters](https://eightmeters.countable.ca/)
to overcome some of the challenges of remote work. Make sure to log your
time daily according to appropriate project tags, including links to
appropriate Trello cards or document deliverables when possible.

## Workflow Checklist

This workflow checklist covers mostly things we should already be doing.
If it's something we're still working towards, it's in *italics*.

### Meetings

  - Be on time, or notify as early as possible about absence or lateness
    and offer something instead (here's my summary so you can read it).
    See Commitments, below.
  - *Everyone should share something. Prepare what you want to say (that fits the meeting agenda), and even send it to team members before the meeting.*
  - If you have a proposal or idea, write it up in detail, and share it ahead of time. Indicate how it impacts something we care about (OKR).

### Commitments

  - Be clear and specific about commitments. Say "I'll send you a
    prototype link at 2pm" rather than "I'll be done after lunch". *This
    should be in writing, such as in a Trello ticket (in this case, set
    a deadline on the ticket too.)*
  - If you're not going to meet a commitment, tell the team as early as
    possible, and explain what the gap will be, and how close you are.
    Explain what else you can do to help.

### Every Day You Work

  - Share something with the team every day. The simplest way to do this
    is to report what you did on Slack in your team's channel, and
    anything you're stuck on. Shooting a quick [screen cap video](/operations/PM_TOOLS/SCREENCASTIFY.md)
    to share is a great idea to try out.
  - Check slack twice a day at least, and react/respond to some other
    team members' posts.
  - Commit your code and push it to bitbucket every day.
  - Fill your timesheet (end of the day)
  - Check your company Email

### Every Week

  - Communicate with each client you are working with: Send them an
    update on what's done and what's pending out of their current
    expectations. Include a link to staged work, and a screenshot or
    video. It's best to do this Friday or Monday.

### Do Not

  - Use private messages for things that don't need to be private. Share
    your experiences on your projects in your client channel, and if
    it's more widely applicable, (\#client-) in \#general.
    [Transparency](/philosophy/TRANSPARENCY/)

## Time Off

Countable's intention is allow a great deal of flexibility to everyone,
while ensuring we work at predictable times and can depend on one
another. The important things are to make sure your team can rely on you
being around when you say you will, and that you don't burn out. So, you
can generally work when you want, but you should communicate when that
will be.

  - Employees (not subcontractors) based in Canada are subject to labour
    laws and as such have vacation pay, stat holidays, over-time, etc.
  - Sub-contractors may take unpaid leave any time, and should take at
    least 2 weeks throughout the year.
  - By default, assume your team mates won't work on Canadian stat
    holidays or weekends, so don't be surprised if you do not get a
    response to messages. However, you are welcome to work
  - Everyone must plan and document their regular hours in Google Calendar's [Working Hours](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/7638168?hl=en).
    These should comprise at least half of the hours you work.
  - If you are away during scheduled time, please let your team know in
    advance and help them plan. If it's less than a day, same-day or
    one-day advance notice is fine. If it's more than a day, notify your
    team members a few days in advance. Note your absence on the
    Countable Absences shared calendar.
  - We expect remote team members outside of the America/Vancouver
    timezone to have a 50% overlap with the Vancouver timezone (work
    half their time in PST).
  - Remove yourself from calendar events you won't attend.

## Remote Work Basics

Countable is a fully remote team, which has certain pros and cons. The
top "cons" reported on other remote teams are:

  - Loneliness / Isolation
  - Collaborating / Communicating

Things to try.

  - Weekly team Lunch. Can we schedule a video call for a weekly lunch?
    Figure out what day works for everyone.
  - Shorter coffee-break video call, daily.
  - Video collaboration time on projects. Casual mob coding, async
    coding allowed too.

## Solving Problems

We aim to onboard people we can trust to make good decisions to the team. 

If you've been with us for 3 months or more, and you think you can solve
a problem for our team for less than $100, feel free to do so and submit
for compensation with context.
