# Dismissal

**Purpose**

To make it clear how and when dismissal might occur at Countable.

**Scope**

A brief list of issues that can lead to dismissal.

### Dismissal at Countable

While it sounds like a negative thing, not everyone is a fit for
Countable's culture. We think many people are talented but could have a
bigger impact elsewhere which is better for everyone. Things that could
result in you being dismissed:

  - Fail to communicate with users, team, and customers resulting in
    problems.
  - Fail to exhibit most of the behaviours listed at and below your
    current job level.
  - Fail to take responsibility when you make a mistake, and learn how
    to prevent it next time.
  - Miss meetings or appointments.
  - Lose track of client requests because they're not properly logged in
    Trello, or backlog's not monitored.
  - Produce low quality work that's not thoughtful of our future selves
    and which the team wouldn't be proud of.
  - Avoid hard discussions and be a "yes person" without thinking about
    what you're agreeing to.
  - Go "dark" so clients and team mates are unclear about the project
    status (no response for over 1 business day, when a response is
    clearly expected)
