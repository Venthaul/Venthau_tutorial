# Job Level 3 Evaluation Questions

**Purpose**

To outline self-evaluation for Level 3: owns a client relationship, leads in a technical area within a guild, or
takes on another area of responsibility.

**Scope**

Covers self-evaluation questions for job level 3, for both general criteria and technical (guild) tracks.

### Evaluation Criteria 

**Professional Development**

  - Helps to support and teach other team members things inside your
    technical track, OR takes responsibility for their results and
    timelines for at least one specific client or project with multiple
    team members assigned to it.
  - Is competent in more than 1 technical track, and has basic knowledge
    of all 4. (UX, devops, dev, operations)
  - Takes accountability for our team's role in business objectives of
    our clients.
  - Tracks and improves metrics. Is aware of some numbers that matter to
    the company and engages the team in discussing them.

**Communications**

  - Makes some contributions to the Ops Manual or other documentation
    resources
  - Takes responsibility for clients' business results. Doesn't blame
    the client, or external factors. Finds a way to achieve the desired
    outcome by working around challenges you cannot control.

**Project Management**

  - Find ways to increase our iteration speed to get closer to the goal
    quickly.
  - Works towards a clear, shared goal with the client. Follows up on
    discussions in a constructive way (with respect to objectives). Once
    it's clear, prototype something to validate assumptions as quickly
    as possible.
  - Takes responsibility for the overall success of one or more existing
    clients or projects.

#### Technical Track Questions

**UX**

  - Plans, manages and executes the user research in projects on time to
    align all stakeholders on a shared understanding of real needs.
  - Teach others to connect with users themselves, and provides
    resources for getting clear frequent user feedback to the team.

**Devs**

  - Engages team in discussion of architecture (compares different
    options with pros/cons)
  - Demonstrates technical ability to create and lead development on a
    new project and arrive at a business result.

**Operations**

  - Engages team in discussion and documentation of processes to ensure
    we have clear goals, plans and roles.
  - Contributes new content to Ops Manual pages, and tags in others to
    contribute where appropriate.

**DevOps**

  - Lead discussions on security and/or devops quality metrics
  - Implement systemic improvements applicable to all/most projects
