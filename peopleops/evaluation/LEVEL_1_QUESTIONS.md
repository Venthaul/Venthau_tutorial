# Job Level 1 Evaluation Questions

**Purpose**

To outline self-evaluation for Level 1: an internship or junior position.

**Scope**

Covers self-evaluation questions for job level 1, for both general criteria and technical (guild) tracks.


### Evaluation Criteria 

**Professional Development**

  - Regularly reviews other team members' work, and asks questions about
    it (code reviews, XD links, shared videos, stage sites)
  - You are dependable. The team feels they can rely on you do follow
    through with things. You document tasks (Trello usually) and follow
    up on them.
  - Tries to solve problems yourself. But then, asks questions.

**Communications**

  - Makes meetings on time, checks both email and slack daily, and
    notifies of absence in advance (and follows communications charter)
  - Often refers to the operations manual, and asks questions about it
    when something is unclear or could be improved.
  - Makes consistent improvement of any size to the systems around you
    (flag outdated content from the ops manual, small refactors such as
    renaming a variable for clarity, make a small design or usability
    improvement).
  - Shows gratitude to the team (for example, mention them in the
    \#thanks channel) or thank them on other channels.
  - Shares work (screenshots, staging links, XD links, code snippets)
    with the team and clients in your client- and guild- channels,
    because seeing great work raises the bar for everyone and is very
    motivating.

**Project Management**

  - Speaks up, and asks questions during meetings, because you shouldn't
    be in a meeting if you don't contribute.
  - Checks OKRs mid-month, and asks for help.

#### Technical Track Questions

**UX**

  - Makes an effort to understand and interact with end users. For
    example, is present in discovery meetings, user interviews,
    usability sessions.
  - Identifies personas using each UI and how, and tests their user
    stories (UATs) when developing user interfaces (on devices they
    use). Test your work\!

**Devs**

  - Leave comments in your own code asking questions when you submit
    your own pull request
  - Completed all training during the onboarding and presented at least
    once during a developers guild meeting.

**Operations**

  - Asks questions outside their own guilds about how and why things
    work at the company.
  - Shares feedback about what they like and suggestions to improve.

**DevOps**

  - Complete Docker training, and is comfortable running our projects
    locally
  - Complete Linux training and has a Linux laptop or VM for local work
