## Setting Up Your Desk

### Equipment Requirements

You'll need:

  - Good quality headset with mic. Cheap options we've verified to work
    well:
    [wired](https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Microphone-Cancelling-Lightweight-Headphones/dp/B06XWG12QS/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1531614591&sr=8-2&keywords=headset+wired+-wireless#customerReviews)
    or
    [bluetooth](https://www.amazon.com/New-bee-Bluetooth-Cancelling-Headsetcase/dp/B07FMSJZ3R).
    Countable will reimbuse up to $40 on this.
  - A computer. If you're a developer, it should have either Linux or
    MacOS (we don't use Windows for work). If you're a developer or
    designer, you want 4GB or more of RAM, 128GB or more of disk, and a
    core i3 or better CPU. We recommend dell XPS series OR a desktop. We
    recommend Ubuntu LTS or Elementary OS.
  - A quiet, hopefully cool, room to work from with a stable internet
    connection. When you `ping 8.8.8.8` you should get no dropped
    packets or numbers over 100ms.
