# Compensation and Benefits

**Purpose**

Establishes the norms and policies which guide our collaboration at Countable.

**Scope**

Covers the principles behind our compensation strategy, as well as benefits and medical provided to our team.

## Compensation Schedule
  * Staff must submit hours for a given month within 24h of end date (PST) of that month in order to be paid on time.
  * Domestic (Canada) staff (with Canadian bank accounts) are paid within 1 week of the start of the month, for the prior period.
  * Other staff are paid within 2 weeks of the start of the month, for the prior period.
  * If you are not paid within this period, please contact our current book keeper.

## Compensation Strategy Principles

Covers our basic principles and approach to compensating our team.

Not everyone will agree with this approach, so it's important we state it here so we don't have someone with different expectations join the team.

1.  Our approach is to pay people enough to live in reasonable comfort and to generally be competitive with other opportunities, but we would rather start with lower rates and give generous raises compared to other companies. 
    - This is very important in order to preserve our culture, because if we pay too high initially it will result in many staff joining because of the high pay, and not because they are a good fit with our many unusual values and methods.
2.  Once an employee has completed some OKRs and demonstrated they can push the team towards our mission, they will get a substantial raise. 
    - At this point, we trust they've been vetted to be a cultural fit. 
    - The raise will be weighted towards stock so that those who contribute are co-owners of Countable Web Productions Inc.
3.  This will absolutely lead to unequal pay - if you're good you'll be paid a lot more than someone who's still learning to be productive.
    - On the positive side, this allows us to afford to hire students who still have some basic knowledge to develop in order to be productive. 
    - I think this is great because it will attract people who propel us forward over time, and avoid accumulating people who coast, by encouraging them to either improve or leave. It's much
    more motivating working with the former people.
4.  If you're assigned a change in compensation, that will take a effect starting in your next pay period, not immediately, nor backdated to past hours.

## Benefits

1.  Payment for benefits and expenses directly reimbursable will be included like other expenses, alongside payroll.
2.  If necessary, the company will purchase a Linux computer for you.
    - The specs will be commensurate with what your manager decides you need after discussing your job. You may not all get the same specs as others at the company.

#### Extended Medical

We don't currently have an extended medical group insurance plan (partly as we don't yet have USA employees who tend to be more reliant on this), but we'd like to help out a little when our team has dental or other uninsured medical costs. 

In the future, we plan to improve our coverage of medical costs but this is a start.

1.  Full time contractors (100h/mo or more) and employees receive 50% reimbursement for medical expenses, up to $1000 CAD per calendar year.
2.  Part time contractors (50h/mo or more) receive 30% reimbursement for medical expenses, up to $1000 CAD per calendar year.

### Subcontractors in the Philippines

Recognizing that we have a significant number of team members based in the Philippines, we have enhanced our benefits package to provide better support to them.
