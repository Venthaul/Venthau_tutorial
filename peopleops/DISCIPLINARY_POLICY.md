# Disciplinary Policy

**Purpose**

At Countable, we are committed to maintaining a positive work environment that promotes professionalism, mutual respect, and productivity. This Disciplinary Action Policy outlines our approach to addressing employee misconduct and performance issues in a fair and consistent manner. While we prioritize hiring employees who are a strong fit for our company culture, we are providing this outline for potential disciplinary actions in case they are needed in exceptional circumstances.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all employees and subcontractors of Countable, regardless of their job position or employment type.

### Types of Offenses

The following are examples of misconduct and performance issues that may lead to disciplinary action:
  - Violation of company policies or rules.
  - Unsatisfactory work performance or failure to meet performance expectations.
  - Attendance and punctuality issues.
  - Failure to follow communication protocols or not sending work updates as required.
  - Insubordination or disrespectful behavior.
  - Harassment, discrimination, or any form of workplace misconduct.
  - Unauthorized use of company resources.
  - Violation of confidentiality or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information
  - Theft, dishonesty, or fraud.

### Progressive Discipline

We generally follow a progressive approach, as outlined below:
1. **Initial Written Warning**:
   - For minor offenses or first-time occurrences, the Team Lead may issue an initial written warning through an email.
   - The purpose is to communicate the issue, provide feedback, and encourage improvement. The written warning will detail the ***specific concerns, expectations for improvement, and a timeframe for reassessment***.
   - The employee will be provided with an opportunity to discuss the issues with their Lead and seek clarification if needed.
2. **Coaching and Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)**:
   - If the performance or conduct issues persist after the initial written warning, the employee will be placed on a Coaching and Performance Improvement Plan (PIP).
   - The PIP will be designed to address the specific areas of concern and will include ***clear goals, expectations, and a timeline for improvement***.
   - During the PIP period, the employee's Lead or designated coach will provide ***guidance, feedback, and necessary support*** to help the employee achieve the desired level of performance or conduct.
3. **Final Written Warning and Dismissal**:
   - If the employee does not demonstrate significant improvement within the specified timeframe of the PIP or if there are serious performance or conduct issues, a final written warning will be issued.
   - The final written warning will clearly state the ***consequences of further non-compliance or failure to improve***.
   - In exceptional cases where the employee fails to meet the required standards or the severity of the misconduct warrants it, the company may proceed with ***[dismissal](https://countable-web.github.io/ops/peopleops/DISMISSAL/#dismissal)***.

### Investigation Process

Before taking disciplinary action, Countable will conduct a fair and impartial investigation. This may include gathering evidence, interviewing relevant parties, and providing the employee with an opportunity to respond.

### Employee Rights

During the disciplinary process, employees have the right to:

  - Present their side of the story and provide any relevant evidence.
  - Have a representative present during meetings related to the disciplinary action.

### Appeals Process

Employees have the right to appeal any disciplinary decision they believe to be unjust. The appeal process will involve an impartial review of the case.

### Confidentiality

All information related to the disciplinary process will be handled with strict confidentiality to protect the privacy of all parties involved.

### Review and Update

Countable reserves the right to review and update this disciplinary action policy as necessary.
