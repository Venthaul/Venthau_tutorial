# Disciplinary Action

**Purpose**

At Countable, we are committed to maintaining a positive work environment that promotes professionalism, mutual respect, and productivity. This Disciplinary Action Policy outlines our approach to addressing employee misconduct and performance issues in a fair and consistent manner. While we prioritize hiring employees who are a strong fit for our company culture, we are providing this outline for potential disciplinary actions in case they are needed in exceptional circumstances.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all employees and subcontractors of Countable, regardless of their job position or employment type.

### Types of Offenses

The following are examples of misconduct and performance issues that may lead to disciplinary action:
  - Violation of company policies or rules.
  - Unsatisfactory work performance or failure to meet performance expectations.
  - Attendance and punctuality issues.
  - Failure to follow communication protocols or not sending work updates as required.
  - Insubordination or disrespectful behavior.
  - Harassment, discrimination, or any form of workplace misconduct.
  - Unauthorized use of company resources.
  - Violation of confidentiality or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information
  - Theft, dishonesty, or fraud.

### Progressive Discipline

We generally follow a progressive approach, as outlined below:
1. **Verbal Warning**: For minor offenses or first-time occurrences, the immediate supervisor may issue a verbal warning. The purpose is to communicate the issue, provide feedback, and encourage improvement.
2. **Written Warning**: If the misconduct or performance issues persist, a written warning will be given. The written warning will detail the problem, the expected improvement, and the timeframe for improvement.
3. **Final Written Warning**: In cases of repeated offenses, or if the initial written warning does not lead to improvement, a final written warning may be issued. This warning will emphasize the seriousness of the situation and the potential for further disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
4. **Suspension**: For severe or persistent misconduct or performance issues, a temporary suspension may be implemented. The duration of the suspension will depend on the specific circumstances and the severity of the offense.
5. **Dismissal**: [Dismissal](https://countable-web.github.io/ops/peopleops/DISMISSAL/#dismissal) is a last resort, but it may be necessary if the employee fails to improve or engages in serious misconduct.

### Investigation Process

Before taking disciplinary action, Countable will conduct a fair and impartial investigation. This may include gathering evidence, interviewing relevant parties, and providing the employee with an opportunity to respond.

### Employee Rights

During the disciplinary process, employees have the right to:
  - Be informed of the specific allegations against them.
  - Present their side of the story and provide any relevant evidence.
  - Have a representative present during meetings related to the disciplinary action.

### Appeals Process

Employees have the right to appeal any disciplinary decision they believe to be unjust. The appeal process will involve an impartial review of the case.

### Confidentiality

All information related to the disciplinary process will be handled with strict confidentiality to protect the privacy of all parties involved.

### Review and Update

Countable reserves the right to review and update this disciplinary action policy as necessary.
