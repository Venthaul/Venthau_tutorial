# Benefits for PH Team Members


**Purpose**

Over time, as we have established a significant presence of team members in the Philippines, we have progressively enhanced our benefits to better cater to their needs and provide comprehensive assistance.

**Scope**

This section details the benefits specifically designed for subcontractors residing in the Philippines. Our objective is to improve this in the future, but at the moment, this represents what we can provide.

## Benefits

While [subcontractors](https://countable-web.github.io/ops/peopleops/SUBCONTRACTOR_AGREEMENT/#term) are not considered employees, they are not entitled to the same benefits as regular employees in the Philippines. However, we offer a competitive package tailored to subcontractors' needs.
Team members operating in the Philippines can reap the benefits outlined below. 

- Taxes - Subcontractors are responsible for independently filing their own taxes. <br> In the Philippines, freelancers are generally classified as self-employed individuals for tax purposes. They are subject to the applicable tax laws and regulations governing self-employment income. Freelancers are required to register with the [Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR)](https://www.bir.gov.ph/index.php/eservices.html) and fulfill their tax obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying the appropriate taxes on their freelance income. 
- Medical and Insurance Benefits  - While we do not have partnered insurance companies, we can still provide assistance with insurance coverage and medical expenses. We offer a maximum monthly reimbursement of $50 for Life Insurance and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) expenses. For suggestions, feel free to reach out to [Justin](mailto:justin@countable.ca).
- SSS, HDMF, PhilHealth - As subcontractors, we are not responsible for providing statutory benefits typically offered to employees. However, you have the option to personally avail yourself of these benefits. <br> [SSS](https://www.sss.gov.ph/) stands for the Social Security System in the Philippines. SSS is a social insurance program that provides various benefits, such as retirement, disability, maternity, sickness, and death benefits, to its members. <br> [HDMF](https://www.pagibigfundservices.com/), also known as Pag-IBIG Fund, is a government agency in the Philippines that manages a national savings program. It aims to provide housing loans and financial assistance to its members for home acquisition, construction, improvement, or rental purposes. <br> [PhilHealth](https://www.philhealth.gov.ph/) is a national health insurance program. Its purpose is to provide affordable and accessible healthcare services to its members by covering a portion of their medical expenses, such as hospitalization, consultations, and diagnostic procedures.
- 13th Month Pay - We do not provide a 13th-month pay. However, we do offer pay raises based on performance as a form of recognition.
- Leaves - We provide a total of 30 annual paid leaves, prorated accordingly, which includes 10 sick leaves, 10 vacation leaves, and 10 public holiday leaves.
- Parental Leave - After completing one year of service, we grant a generous 12-week parental leave.
- Remote Work Setup - One of the standout advantages of working at Countable is our fully remote setup. You have the flexibility to work from anywhere in the Philippines, as long as you have your [equipment](https://countable-web.github.io/ops/peopleops/SETTING_UP/#equipment-requirements) and a reliable internet connection.
- Office Equipments - We provide [financial assistance](https://countable-web.github.io/ops/peopleops/EXPENSES/#equipment-expenses) for office equipment. We offer a reimbursement of 50% (up to a total of $1000 every 2 years) for personally-owned computer equipment that you utilize for remote work purposes.
- Flexible Work Hours - We offer highly flexible scheduling options. You have the freedom to arrange your work hours to accommodate your personal needs. However, it is essential to maintain a 2-hour overlap with Pacific Standard Time.
- Promotion - Advancement opportunities are available based on individual performance, allowing for potential promotions.
- Pay Raise - We provide opportunities for pay raises, still based on individual performance, and if desired, these increases can also be received in the form of equity through stock options.
- Other Benefits - [Here](https://countable-web.github.io/ops/peopleops/EXPENSES/#examples-of-things-the-company-will-pay-for) are additional benefits that the company will pay for.  Additionally, for our team members based in the Philippines, we have included the following perks:
  - Free Drink - You are eligible for reimbursement of up to $20 per month for any beverages you order while collaborating with teammates.
  - Team Activities - We provide a reimbursable budget specifically allocated for team activities and company outings, which is subject to review.
