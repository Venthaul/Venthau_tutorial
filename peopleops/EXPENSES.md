title: Expenses at Countable
---

**Purpose**

To clearly identify what is and is not covered as an expense at Countable, and how to properly request compensation for expenses.

**Scope**

Covers equipment expenses, what else the company will cover, and how to claim expenses.

### Equipment Expenses

  - Any expense over $100 must be approved in advance of the purchase in
    order to be reimbursed.
  - Countable will provide a (loaner) linux laptop if you use that as
    your primary work machine. We subsidize Linux because it helps the
    team learn about our servers, Docker and other critical components
    of our business that use Linux. We want a bias to moving as much
    infrastructure in that direction as possible but recognize not
    everything works there yet (Adobe, I'm looking at you).
  - Countable will pay 50% up to $1000 total every 2 years for computer
    equipment you use for work remotely, which is owned by you
    personally. If the expense would bring the total claimed over $1000
    in the 2 year period prior to the current date, the claim is not
    reimbursed.
  - We studiously avoid Microsoft Windows at Countable. It's not as
    automatable as Linux, and prevents people from learning Unix which
    is a core competency at Countable. To be eligible for
    resimbursement, Windows laptops must also have Linux installed on a
    partition (bootable, not a VM).
  - Special expenses may be approved if required for your job. These
    must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis prior to purchase. ie,
    Countable may pay for co-working space if you need one.
  - Expenses at or below $100 are not approved in advance but are
    reviewed instead for reimbursement (you can ask if you're not sure,
    but if you can solve any real problem for $100 or less, ask for
    forgiveness rather than permission.) See the next section for
    guidelines.
