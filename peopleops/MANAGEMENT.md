# Management

## Purpose

Provide high level guidance to managers at the company to set them up for success. Managers should primarily act as a coach to help
the employee grow at the company, and to help create clear goals on outcomes that are good for the team.

## Feedback

 * Hold monthly one-on-one meetings with your reports. This is meant to ensure the person is enjoying their time at the company, learning, improving and having positive interactions with others at the company.
 * You should pay lots of attention to the outputs of your team, and provide feedback on those. Give feedback on what they produce NOT how they do it generally (that is micro managing).
 * Provide feedback often in different channels (public and private). Feedback should be specific and factual (not sweeping or general).
 * Negative feedback should be private and take the form of how something differed from your expectation, factually. State what you observed, and let the other person speak to it. Ask them how it will be improved next time.
 * If the above doesn't fit well, try asking an open ended question about the topic "I wonder if this outcome works well for your team mate...", and let them fill the blanks.
 * Feedback should be given as if you're helping someone remember what they forgot, not what they couldn't see.
