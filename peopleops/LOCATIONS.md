## COVID-19 Safety Plan

For all staff and subcontractors:

  - As a remote-first company, it's much easier for us to manage COVID-19 safety by default.
  - Do not attend the office if you have any symptoms.
  - If you do attend the office, avoid touching your face, approaching within 6 feet of a colleague, and wash your hands regularly.
  - If you suspect you may be infected, refer to the Cortico COVID-19 screening form for a list of symptoms and book an appointment if you have concerns at [KMC's walk-in](https://kmc.cortico.ca/book/first-available-walk-in/)
