**Purpose**

Countable is divided into Guilds and Teams. The job of Guilds is to be really good at specific things, and the job of Teams is to get results for customers.

**Scope**

This document lists our existing Guilds and Teams.

## List of Guilds

  - [DevOps](../../devops/DEVOPS/) - Their goal is to ensure our software is delivered to customers as quickly, reliably and automatically as possible.
  - [Developers](../../developers/DEVELOPERS/) - Their goal is to improve our code, solve problems for users, and demonstrate working software to our team every day.
  - [UX](ux/UX/) - Their goal is to help everyone, from users to product owners and developers, enjoy and benefit from interacting with our software.
  - [Operations](../../operations/OPERATIONS/) - Their goal is maintaining clear and open communication with our clients, and maintaining the roadmap to sustainable growth for our firm.
  
#### Monthly Guild Meetings

Each month we hold a meeting for any technical specialty the team is interested in. Currently there's a developer's guild meet, a devops meet, an operations meet, and a design/ux guild meet.

## Cross-Functional Teams

We have cross-functional teams organized by Objective. For example, we have a `bawkbox` team whose top level objective is to make it easy for any website to install any 3rd party widget.

With each of our clients, we form a team with some of our staff.

Countable does not have functional team divisions by job role.

TODO

further refine my first pass at defining Cortico relationship below

Countable helped develop [Cortico](https://cortico.ca/), and our team still serve as the active developers on the software itself. When working on Cortico as a Countable developer, treat the work and working relationship as you would that with any of our clients, even though there's a bit more "in-house" feel within our close team!

## Other Informal Groups

On some occasions other groups may organize for professional development
or other purposes. These are not `teams` in our company's terminology.

## Training at Countable

We have official training materials here: [Training](../../developers/TRAINING/). Bill for your time doing any of these.

**Books**

If you buy a book for work, the company will reimburse you.

Suggested reading in [References](../../philosophy/REFERENCES/) that has influenced our culture and methods.

## Performance Evaluation Policy

See our dedicated [Evaluation](../../developers/EVALUATION/) processes.

## Team Event Basics

As a company with remote employees, we intend that half of recreational events can be attended online.

When in-person events are held in just one city, employees may self-organize events in their respective cities and be reimbursed by Countable. 

The default cap is $25/person, for other amounts please get approval from your manager.

We are aiming to do more consistent and repeated virtual events- if you have an idea for something cool we can all try out online, please share it in Slack!
