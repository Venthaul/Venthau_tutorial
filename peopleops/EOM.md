**Purpose**

To minimize the time our technical team members spend on administrative overhead, and "cluster" it all into one trackable checklist.

**Scope**

Covers the EOM (End-of-Month) checklist we create as a Trello card, assigned to each member to fulfill bookkeeping, admin, as well as rating OKRs, self-evaluation, and setting up goals for the upcoming month.

## Creating an EOM Checklist Card in Trello

Once you’ve finished onboarding, you are now familiar with how we use Trello as a task management tool. Though creating an EOM Checklist is done by our Operations Coordinator, it useful for every member of the team to be aware of how we conduct these kinds of tasks:

1. Go to the [Admin and Ops Trello board](https://trello.com/b/mHsqriyY/admin-and-ops)
2. Make a copy of the [EOM Template](https://trello.com/c/FxEDJezN) referencing direct manager (found in the Ideas/Resources list)
3. Change or specify necessary information such as month, assignee, and the list you should put the card under (*Sprint* List)
4. We do self-evaluation and setting up learning goals quarterly, so take this section off of the list unless it's January or July.

## Bookkeeping and Admin

This section of the checklist covers timekeeping, updating your working hours when applicable, and a quick Trello audit.

* Make sure all of your hours worked for the month and expenses to be recomped are logged in [Eightmeters](https://countable-web.github.io/ops/peopleops/EIGHTMETERS/)
* Update your “Working Hours” in [Google Calendar](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/7638168?hl=en) with your @countable.ca account, making sure this still reflects your current availability.
* Trello Audit - update Trello cards assigned to you and move them under the appropriate list. If you are stuck, leave notes or comments for your teammates about your status and the area that you need support with.

## PeopleOps and Company Vision

Under this checklist, we allot 1-on-1’s with your manager, rating of OKRs of the month, and start drafting for next month’s OKRs.

* Book a 1-on-1 with your manager for the coming month using their Calendly link
* Review and rate your OKRs from last month on Eightmeters
* Think about, and draft, at least two OKRs on Eightmeters for the upcoming month

## Twice Annually

Doing self-evaluation and setting up personal learning goals twice a year gives us insight into whether the team is rowing in the same direction to move the company forward.

* Self-Evaluation - assess your performance based on [these evaluation questions](https://countable-web.github.io/ops/peopleops/evaluation/EVALUATION/#evaluation-questions-by-job-level) by job level
* Learning Goals - set three objectives for team tools/methodologies you want to learn more about
