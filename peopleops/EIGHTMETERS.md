# Eightmeters

**Purpose**

To identify how to use our in-house social timesheet application.

**Scope**

Currently a basic draft, with room for further detail and feature
exploration.

## What is Eightmeters

Eightmeters is a "social timesheet" web app that we
created internally at Countable to help us feel more
connected as virtual workers. It allows us to see
the stream of what others are working on, within our
projects and teams.

### Getting Started

Once you have a countable-issued email address, you can
use that to log in to [eightmeters.countable.ca](http://eightmeters.countable.ca/) via Google Login.

Reach out to [operations@countable.ca](mailto:operations@countable.ca) if you do not see any project or team tags after login- they may need to add you!

### How to Enter Your Time

First navigate to the affiliated team, then select the specific
project or category you worked on for this time period. These
are lists of standardized slugs; clarify with your direct manager
if you're not sure what some of the slugs you see are for.

#### Entry Fields for Recording Time

*  **Date:**
    * Select the appropriate date in the first field.
*  **Hours Worked:**
    * Enter the time you spent on the project in this time period. Enter time in decimal format (1 hour and 30 mins should be entered as 1.5 hours). Unless you're reporting a specific, small deliverable, feel free to round to ~0.5 hour when estimating your time.
*  **Work Description:**
    * Describe the work in a few words that indicate specific progress and outcomes you worked on for most of that day, in a language clients will understand. Between 3 and 20 words is the right level of detail. If you're entering the same phrase every day, you're not being specific enough.
    * Never combine line items between projects. If you worked on 2 different codes (project slugs) during the day, they must be separate line items.
    * Client pay us to do work and does not care about your environment setup, training, or who works with who. Just indicate what task/objective the client requires that you were working on, any progress or setbacks, and status. **Note:** this does not mean you should *not* log your setup time, just include it within the hours worked that you report for the related task.
        * *Bad example:* "environment setup". Nobody cares about your environment in this context. It's an input not an output. Mention why you need to the environment and the larger task it will help you complete.
        * *Bad example:* "worked with person X". nobody cares who on our team you worked with, and as you can see it can cause the client to dispute the invoice. Mention WHAT you were working on and specifically what you accomplished on that.
        * *Bad example:* "sprint meeting". Instead, mention a key decision at the meeting or topic that helped accomplish our assigned tasks and goals.
        * *Good example:* Completed Trello Task "Title copied here". Changed deployment parameters so that we could meet our goal of reducing downtime during deploys. Prepared report on test coverage, based on request from client.
*  **Trello or BitBucket ref:**
    * Also include at least one of: references to issues in Trello, Commit IDs. Link to trello cards can be found in "Share and more..." after opening a card.

    
### How to Enter Your Expenses 

* Just as with time entries, navigate based on team and project codes (for most expenses, this will be `countable` > `admin`)
* Descriptions of expenses can be brief, but should be detailed enough that it is understandable to your manager and accounting. If expenses were not incurred in Canadian Dollars, please include the original currency amount in the description as well. 
* Upload an image of the receipt using the "Choose Files" button before submitting

## Figuring Out What To Bill

  * Describe the work in a few words that indicate specific outcomes you worked on for most of that day, in a language clients will understand. Between 3 and 20 words is the right level of detail.
  * Do not enter the same description for multiple days. Indicate what was different about each day you worked. This is easy if you enter your time every day.
  * The `countable` > `training` project pays for your time training and learning things you need for your job (must be official training materials, or approved)
      * Training necessary for a specific project should be coded to that project.
  * Use the `countable` > `training` project for time discussing how Countable operates with team members.
  * If you're not sure what's billable, generally anything we ask you to do is billable, and anything we "invite" you to do is optional and not billable. 
      * Training is only billable if it's requested by the company that you complete specific materials, or you're learning something immediately required to solve a problem in your work. 
      * Attending events, conferences, etc, is not paid unless we require you to go for marketing or another purpose (but we'll often pay for your tickets in any case). 
      * Commuting is not paid unless it's to a client's office. 
      * Social events aren't paid.
  * Billing for travel time: If we meet each other only, or go to a workspace with no clients, transit time is not billable. When visiting clients, it is billable.
