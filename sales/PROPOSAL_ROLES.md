## Proposal Writing Roles

**Assign these roles to people at the top of the proposal draft:**

#### Coordinator

This is the most important role in the process, driving forward everyone
else'sales involvement and contributions. The coordinator's job is to
make sure: \* The rest of the process below is followed by our team. \*
It's clear in writing (Google Docs comments) who contributes what parts
right away. \* We finish early so we have time (ideally 5 days) for
external review. \* Double-check each contributor doesn't miss any
mandatory requirements or scored criteria. \* Compiling the final
deliverables in the correct format for submission. \* The proposal is
submitted on-time, making sure that any submission pre-requisites are
met well in advance. Submitting right before the deadline will often
result in a failure to submit correctly.

#### Internal Reviewer

Identify someone to simulate the client scoring your proposal later on.
They shouldn't be involved in writing.

When they are tagged in to review the document, they should be directed
in a meaningful way to not just the working document, but the original
RFP description and specific evaluation criteria or rubric.

#### Technical Authors

The Coordinator should ensure it's clear to each technical author what
section they must contribute. Use Google Docs task assignments.
