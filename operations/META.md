**Purpose**

This page outlines how to contribute to the Countable Ops Manual in both a technical sense (using Github-flavoured Markdown in a Jekyll Github Pages site, using Just-the-Docs theme and some experimental bidirectional linking) and a stylistic sense (how pages should be structured and what they should contain).

**Scope**

Currently holds content on linking best practices, a draft on Writing Ops Manual Pages (stylistically) and the first attempt at outlining the basics of formatting and structure.

## How to Add Links

Best convention for linking to other files: ../devops/DEVOPS.md

## Writing Ops Manual Pages

This is a *draft*. Please take these as a rough guide for now, and let
me (cvo) know what works and what doesn't. You can add sections not
documented here.

  - An Ops Manual page **MUST**:
    
      - be written to help employees achieve our mission and create
        value for our customers.
      - have a "Purpose" heading which concisely summarizes why the
        document exists, because we want to ensure the area is important
        to our mission. This SHOULD indicate how we can measure success.

  - An Ops Manual page **SHOULD**:
    
      - Have a "Scope" section that identifies what area of work is
        being discussed, and any definitions to clarify what follows,
        because we want each process document to be focused on a
        specific area of work.
      - Contain bulleted lists of process steps, rules and guidelines.
      - Be concise, becasue it's easier for employees to understand.
      - Clearly state the logical purpose, evidence or citation that
        indicates how the rules help our mission because we want each
        rule to justify its existence. Use the word 'because' (explain
        why the step exists) as needed.

## Processes

  - Documenting processes allows your team to improve together at their
    work. You can talk about how you do things, and how each person can
    do it better. It also sets you up for automation.
    
      - Reach out to your team and make sure they know about, and buy
        into, the process. The best way is to get their help developing
        the process.
      - Test the documented processes with other people. They should
        tell you if it's clear, actionable and effective, and how to
        improve it.
