# Operations

**Purpose**

Operations covers the intersection of business best practices and project management, uniting the interests of devs and clients with the company itself.

**Scope**

This document will give an initial overview of what operations is presumed to cover in this case, plans for the operations guild at
Countable, and link out to more useful reference docs on our processes.

Check out our [Methodology Toolkit](METHODOLOGY.md) at Countable.

## Guidelines at Countable

This operations manual is divided into different types of guidelines, depending on their "strictness".

Unmarked text is simply informational. It's meant to help you and not to constraint your behaviour.

CONVENTION
{: .label .label-blue }
Conventions are simply standard ways of doing things to help us collaborate and communicate efficiently. This could include "best practices".

PROCESS
{: .label .label-purple }
This refers to a process where there is a good reason to do it a specific way. Processes must be clear and actionable (like a checklist.) We will remind each other to follow these. Processes have a cost, so we want the minimum set necesssary. You should have a good reason if you do not follow a process, and if you disagree with it you should discuss having it changed with the team, not just ignore it.

REQUIRED PRACTICES
{: .label .label-red }
We draw special attention to things with severe consequences with this label.

### Developing new Guidelines

Most processes will start out as conventions. 

As you work, experiment and try things. When you can demonstrate something is working really well, discuss making it a convention with the team. Write it down concisely with rationale in the appropriate ops manual page with a
DRAFT
{: .label .label-green }
tag.

Don't rush a new guideline. Over time you can refine it out of draft status.

  - Be clear about when the guideline applies, what the roles are and why it's worth having in concise simple language.
  - Explain the guidline to team members, and get feedback. Testing a guideline is a consultative decision.
  - Our guidelines should be informed by our own experiences and evidence first, consultation with colleagues second, best practices third (processes well known and contained in multiple industry standards), and specific literature from a single author a distant fourth.
  - Lead by example, and update your guideline as you learn.
  - Get feedback from the team.

After your team reviews the guidline it can be promoted to a
CONVENTION
{: .label .label-blue }

or just left as informational.

You should get officer (manager) approval before marking anything as
PROCESS
{: .label .label-purple }

so we can minimize those.

### Company Structure / Governance

Countable is an agency that uses consulting as a source of information to build start-ups.

Countable has projects, and some of those projects can turn into new businesses (KMC\_shifts turned into Cortico in this case). 

Those businesses stay in the team as a project for all intends and purposes at first, but over time they may become more independent. This depends on when they need space to focus on different problems than Countable. 

This model is to help us reconcile the difference between consulting and start-ups. Consulting is a source of information to help us understand problems in the world. If we solve a problem in this area which is replicable, we can spin it off into a new product/business.

### COVID-19 Safety Plan

For all staff and subcontractors:

  - As a remote-first company, it's much easier for us to manage COVID-19 safety by default.
  - Do not attend the office if you have any symptoms.
  - If you do attend the office, avoid touching your face, approaching within 6 feet of a colleague, and wash your hands regularly.
  - If you suspect you may be infected, refer to the Cortico COVID-19 screening form for a list of symptoms and book an appointment if you have concerns at [KMC's walk-in](https://kmc.cortico.ca/book/first-available-walk-in/)
