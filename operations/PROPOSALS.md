# Proposals

**Purpose**

The following are actionable tactics to improve the ROI of time spent
writing proposals.

**Scope**

Covers principles and process for finding and writing proposals at
Countable. The author is most experienced writing proposals for the
public sector.

## Principles

  - The process starts before you start writing. You want to make sure
    the odds are stacked in your favour before you invest in writing
    anything.
  - Specialize\! Choose similar projects, so you can re-use bits of old
    proposals that worked. It's better to solve the same problem really
    well than to spread yourself thin. Choose an RFP in an area where
    you have the most expertise, similar work (including successes to
    hilight), and have a network of people in that area. Countable's
    niches are [web maps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=143&v=PwVRi37qXn8&feature=emb_logo),
    [healthcare](https://cortico.ca) and optimizing citizen flows for
    government.
  - Use your network's experience, and team up. If you know someone who
    would be really great to add to your team, write them into the
    proposal too, and give them a small cut just for being present, even
    if they do very little work.
  - Score before you Send. Get someone who understands the client to
    evaluate your proposal and give you a score based on the official
    criteria before you submit.
  - Ask questions to qualify or disqualify the project, before writing.
    Your questions should increase trust, fill in blanks, and unearth
    hidden needs behind the RFP. Find out the truth about whether you
    can knock it out of the park. Examples "Would you consider a team
    outside your industry who can bring fresh ideas, or prefer a firm
    with lots of industry experience?"
  - Keep the proposal as short as possible while addressing the criteria
    and building trust.

## Specific Proposal Types:

#### Bidding Against ERPs

Often, we are proposing a Django based project as a more flexible,
cheaper, faster and more maintainable alternative to an ERP
implementation (Enterprise Resource Planning). Here are some problems
with ERPs that we solve for our clients:

>   - It takes an average of 11 months after go-live for SMBs to realize
>     benefits from an ERP \[1\], whereas our implementations typically
>     realize benefits in 6 to 8 weeks due to our rapid prototyping
>     approach in the first 2 weeks.
>   - In an ERP usage survey, only 14 of 287 respondents reported
>     realizing the benefits of "Upgrading Technology" with an ERP, and
>     34 of 150 respondents realized the "Growth"-related goals they had
>     when implementing ERP. ERP were more effective at realizing
>     "Operational Efficiency" goals, however with 103 of 122
>     respondents reporting success.
>   - Regarding ERPs "Of those organizations that have completed
>     implementation, less than half (45%) experienced budget overruns.
>     However, those that did experience overruns were an average of 24%
>     over budget. When

youâ€™re talking about an implementation budget, 24% is a lot of money. On
average, organizations reported an expected budget of $1,007,767 and an
actual budget of $1,247,859." \[1\]
