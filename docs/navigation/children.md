# Child Pages

By default, all parent pages will automatically have a 'Table of Contents' at the bottom, showing links to all their child pages.

To disable this automatic list, set `has_toc: false` in the parent page's front matter.

#### Example

```yaml
---
title: UI Components
nav_order: 2
has_toc: false
---
```
