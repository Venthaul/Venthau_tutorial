# Why is AudioArchive using Degoo Cloud for Hosting?

We use Degoo Cloud Because it has 100 GB of Free Storage. On Regular
Hosting Providers, such as Github Pages, Vercel and Gitlab Pages. They
Only Provide you 1 GB worth of free hosting storage. Our Priority is Free
Accessable E-Books, AudioBooks and Music. And we take this Priority very
seriously. We use Github Pages to create this Documentation site, make with
Jekyll/YML. When we have accessibility to funding and better hosting providers,
we will develop a much better system for AudioArchive.
