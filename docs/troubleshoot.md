# Troubleshooting

While creating a form, it is not uncommon to run into some issues. This section will guide you through some of the more common problems that are encountered.

## Unable to Exit Form Preview

When previewing your form, the preview will open itself in a new tab. To exit out of the form preview, simply close the tab it is on by clicking on the `x` on the tab.
