# Troubleshooting

While creating a form, it is not uncommon to run into some issues. This section will guide you through some of the more common problems that are encountered.

## Unable to Exit Form Preview

When previewing your form, the preview will open itself in a new tab. To exit out of the form preview, simply close the tab it is on by clicking on the `x` on the tab.

## Google Form Name Not Changing

When you rename your Google Form, the title on the top left corner and the title in the middle of the page should automatically change to match each other. If they do not match you must manually change the one the title that did not update

## Cannot Edit Google Form

Make sure you are logged into the same Gmail account that you have created your form with. 

To log in, follow these steps:

### 1. Refer to steps 1 and 2 from the [Setting Up a Google Form](./settingUpGoogleForm/settingUpGoogleForm.md) page. You should see a list of recently accessed forms.

### 2. Click on the form you want to edit.

**Note** If you are already logged in but cannot edit a Google form that you were previously able to, you may not be the owner for the form. You will need to contact the owner of the Google form to request for permission to edit.

## Accidental Deletion

Sometimes you may have delete something by accident. If the is the case hold down `cmd` button while pressing the `z` button on your keyboard.
