<a href="https://daotalk.org/c/dx-dao/15" target="_blank">DAOtalk.org</a> is DXdaoâ€™s forum of choice for presenting formal proposals to the DXdao community. This is the place to present and receive feedback for an on-chain vote regarding DXdao strategy, a contributor proposal, or other initiative. Proposals at this stage are often modified to reflect the signal received from the DXdao community in the comments section and polls.
