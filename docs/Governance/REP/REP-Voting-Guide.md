## How to vote on Alchemy using REP

*Note: This guide follows Alchemy on Gnosis Chain. The steps are similar for Ethereum mainnet with a few denoted differences.*
    
**Step 1:**  Go to <a href="https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f" target="_blank">Alchemy on Gnosis Chain</a>. If you are looking for mainnet, visit <a href="https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a" target="_blank">Alchemy on Ethereum</a>. Ensure your wallet is connected to the correct network.
    
**Step 2:** Scrolling through the list of posts, you’ll see a variety of proposals needing to be passed through DXdao's governance. Next to each proposal on the right hand side you’ll see “Executed”, “Passing”, “Failing”, among a few other options. This will let you know whether the proposal is passing or failing, or if voting has already concluded.

*Example:*

**Step 3:** To vote on a proposal with your REP, get started by selecting a proposal of your choice. A box labelled "Votes" can be found on the right side of the screen. This box shows you the amount of REP for or against a proposal, and also allows you to vote using your own REP. 

*Example:*

**Step 4:** You may choose to vote “For” or “Against” for a proposal. If you choose to vote for a proposal to pass, simply click the “For” button and a pop-up will appear for you to confirm your vote. To confirm your vote, click the “For Vote” button at the bottom of the pop-up.
    

*Example:*

**Step 5:** Another pop-up will then appear in the top right hand of your screen (i.e. MetaMask). This again confirms you wish to use your REP to vote for a proposal to pass. Click “Confirm” and your vote will be processed and accepted. If you are on Gnosis Chain, input 1 GWEI to the "Gas Price" since transactions on this chain will always go through at this price.
