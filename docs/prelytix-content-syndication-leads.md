## Accessing your leads 

Content Syndication leads go through a thorough multi-touch quality assurance and exclusion process. This full process can take 1-2 business days to be completed, but timing is of the essence when it comes to lead follow up. To ensure lead follow-up can happen as quickly as possible, you will obtain access to your leads following the first automated process. 

## Handling leads outside of your targeting parameters

There may be times when you notice leads to be outside of your agreed upon targeting parameters. In most cases, your MRP Customer Growth representative will be updating your program to exclude these leads from your goal and remove them from the platform. However, if you notice a lead you believe is outside of your parameters, feel free to reach out to your Customer Growth representative. Once notified, the lead will be removed from the platform within 3 business days. 

## Leads removed from platform

As mentioned, Content Syndication leads go through a thorough multi-touch quality assurance and exclusion process. Upon the first automated process, leads are made available to you within the platform. However, there may be times when you notice a lead you may have had access to, is now removed. This is because of the manual quality assurance process done by MRP. If MRP identifies a lead does not meet your targeting parameters, the lead will be removed from the platform and it will not count towards your goal. 

As always, your Customer Growth representative is here to support you with any questions.
