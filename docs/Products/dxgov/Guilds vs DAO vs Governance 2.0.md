# Guilds vs DAO vs Governance 2.0?

## Short answer: 
Guilds are a small tool and stepping stone to governance 2.0 where governance 2.0 is the larger step forward it’s name suggests it is making a much more extensive DAO framework.

## Longer answer: 
### Current state of governance
There are few DAOs capable of claiming over two years of on-chain governance in a maximally decentralised way. Due to this DXdao has a slightly different view of DAOs than most. To understand our governance platforms its worth taking a look at the current state of governance in the web3 space. The go to standard of governance is a liquid token governance model, it can almost be guaranteed that most defi coins fit into this form of governance. And for good reason, its the most simple and easy solution available due to the existing distribution and understanding of ERC20 tokens. But it’s main problem is that it creates putlocracies. Its fair to call this governance 1.0

### The past two years at DXdao
We have been using the DAOstack framework for our DAO. Now unsupported this way of governance was a completely fresh take on what governance could be. Combining non-transferable reputational voting power (link) and holographic consensus (link) in a framework like architecture it was worlds apart from ERC20 style DAOs. Its tempting to call this Governance 1.5 as an iteration on liquid token governance models, however as can be seen from the diagram it may be better to think of it as an offshoot, something like “Governance Experiment X”. 

### Guilds - extending liquid token voting
As can be seen from the diagram exists very much within the definition of liquid token governance. It is most easily understood by looking at the direction the space went with this form of governance. The current most popular option is via a platform called “Snapshot” in combination with “Gnosis multisigs” improves the user experience (UX) of governance with some key features like free signed voting, simplified actions and close integration with multisigs. However in return it sacrifices decentralisation by utilising centralised database systems and multisigs controlled by a few select individuals. 
Guilds is a simple liquid token based governance tool that addresses many of the centralised issues plaguing current governance without over complicating things. We developed it as a tool for governing individual applications inside our DAO and it has grown to become a general tool which we even view as a stepping stone to governance 2.0.
Augur (link) for example is using a guild to launch an initial DAO to learn and grow their DAO before aiming to take the next steps into what we view proper fair governance as.
On a technical level guilds offer simple governance contracts but with the ability to manage their own funds on chain as we believe any real DAO should. The guild itself can also act, so we have not only signal proposals that rely on trust of ms signers but instead, if a proposal passes it has certain actions carried out by the guild.We also manage free signed voting but in a far more open and transparent way. We also have many growing implementations which add specific features to the base ERC20Guild.
So TLDR; guilds are a simple improved liquid token governance tool

### Governance 2.0
This wont be a full explanation of gov 2.0, thats a little beyond this high level overview’s scope. Governance 2.0 takes the best parts of the DAOstack architecture and combines it with the standard liquid token voting to form what we view as the next generation of governance. This means we have voting power calculated from multiple metrics (mainly reputation and liquid token voting), holographic consensus and more. 
The main difference here is that full DAOs using governance 2.0 have a much more complex system with many configurations to govern. With new wallet schemes we can have individual treasuries inside the DAO for specific purposes that have their own configurations to move faster or more securly. 
So TLDR; Gov 2.0 and by extension DXvote is a much larger framework of lots of contracts for more involved governance.
