# Mainnet Contributor Proposal Guide

___

**Warning**: DXdao contributors currently recommend posting contributor proposals on its Gnosis Chain base for its massively reduced gas costs. You can find that guide [here]({% link docs/ContributorHub/contributor-proposals/xdai-contributor-proposal-guide.md %}).

## Intro:

-   Congratulations on getting the signal to submit a contributor proposal to DXdao!
    
-   At this point, you’ve started the onboarding process, posted a draft of your contributor proposal on <a href="https://daotalk.org" target="_blank">DAOtalk</a>, and the proposal was signalled for an on-chain DXdao vote.
    
-   For details on what should be in the contributor proposal, go to DXdao’s Contributor Guidelines -- Contributor Compensation section.
    
## When to Submit Your Contributor Proposal:

-   A boosted contributor proposal takes approximately **7 days** to pass.
    
-   If a proposal is not boosted, the voting period will last **21 days**.
    
-   A proposal is generally eligible to be boosted **1 day** after the proposal is posted on Alchemy.
    
-   **The Point**:  *You should post your alchemy proposal 1 week before you intend to receive payment for your work with DXdao, and the proposal must be boosted in order for the voting period to shrink to 1 week.*
    
-   You can boost your own contributor proposal once it is eligible to be boosted.

## What You’ll Need:

-   Your ETH account address where you will receive your ETH payment when the proposal passes.
    

    -   Example: 0xed6fA573B2ddB34F6a9a6941b53f7833bF283b02
    

-   An Ethereum address to receive REP. This can be the same as the ETH payment address, but REP cannot be transferred, so pick an address that you will always have access to.
    

  

**Step 1**: Go to <a href="https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a" target="_blank">Alchemy, DXdao’s voting interface</a>, and Click ‘<a href="https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/schemes" target="_blank">Plugins</a>’.

**Step 3**: Calculate your REP allocation.

  

-   First, determine if you are a **full-time** or **part-time** contributor.
    

    -   Full-time contributors may claim **0.1667% REP** for each month they work for DXdao.
    
    -   Part-time contributors may claim **0.08335% REP** per month.
    
    -   Other compensation proposals (bounties, limited contractors, etc.): determine how much REP to request by asking community members and stating the amount in your DAOtalk contributor proposal post. The amount will be somewhere between 0.1% to 0.1667% REP.
    

-   A contributor proposal period is generally 2 months. Unless this is your first time submitting a proposal. In that case, it will be for 2.5 months, to account for your trial period.
    

    -   Contributors submit a proposal for 50% of compensation to be paid when they start their work period.
    
    -   Contributors then submit a separate contributor payment request for the remaining 50% of their compensation at the end of the contributor period, AND two (2) months of REP will also be requested to account for the two (2) months the contributor has been employed by DXdao (0.1667 x 2 = 0.3334).
    

  

### Calculating REP Allocation:

-   Hover over the amount of REP under ‘DAO Holdings’ on the left side of the page. This is the total amount of REP in DXdao.

-   Each contributor takes this number and multiplies it by the num 0.1667% (0.001667) or 0.08335% (0.0008335).
    
    -   E.g. 1,447,134.31 X .001667 = 2412.37
    
-   Put this number in the ‘Reputation Reward’ field when you create the proposal.
    

**Step 4**: Calculate your payment allocation


-   Go to <a href="https://etherscan.io/chart/etherprice" target="_blank">etherscan.io</a> and check the current price of ETH (USD).
    
-   Contributors can use the current price of ETH or the average weekly ETH price.
    
    -   Calculate the amount of ETH for your contributor proposal payment using your determined monthly compensation level. See Contributor Guidelines -- DXdao Compensation Table.
    
    -   Divide your monthly ETH compensation amount in USD by the current price of ETH (USD) to determine the amount of ETH to request in your contributor proposal.
    
    -   Current Monthly ETH Payment (USD) / ETH Price (USD) = ETH Amount
    

    -   E.g.: $7,000 (Level 4) / $1136.29 = 6.16 ETH
    

    -   Put this number in the ‘ETH Reward’ field when you create the proposal.
    
- Alternatively, you may request stable currencies equivilent to a contributors denoted salary.

   - More on this in the proposal.
  

**Step 5**: Click on the ‘+ New Proposal’ button in the top right corner and connect your wallet.

**Note**: Submitting a proposal will require gas, but don’t worry! DXdao refunds 75% of gas costs. <a href="https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-governance-refunds-round-2/2361" target="_blank">Find more information here</a>.

  

### Recommended step:  
  
To make your proposal verifiable and secure, it is ideal to add your Keybase Cryptographic Signature into your proposal.

To do this, follow these steps:


1.  Go to Keybase (on desktop or mobile)
    
2.  Go to “Crypto” in navigation
    
3.  Click “Sign”
    
4.  Type any message into the input field
    
5.  Copy the Signed Message to your Clipboard
    
6.  Paste the entire Signed Message into your Proposal
    

  

Anyone using Keybase will be able to “Verify” what the Signed Message is and that it is from your Keybase handle.
