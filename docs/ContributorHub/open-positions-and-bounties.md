___

DXdao is a collective that builds and governs decentralized products and services. Its current product suite features:
- **Omen**, a prediction market platform; 
- **Swapr**, a governance-enabled multi-chain AMM with custom liquidity mining rewards creation and best-price trading features;
- **Carrot**, a programmable incentive platform;
- **Aqua**, a token sale platform; and 
- **DXvote**, a decentralized governance interface for true on-chain DAOs.

DXdao uses a reputation-based governance system; meaning that voting power, or REP, is non-transferrable and cannot be bought.

DXD is the DXdao native ERC20 token. DXD token holders own future access to a suite of services and a portion of fees accrued in the decentralised applications that the DXdao community creates. With the passage of the <a href="https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0xf57b8345b7bcafdff729e2441900b5340251bcc83a4a4c48c6b273eed7ecb717" target="_blank">Governance 2.0 signal proposal</a>, DXD will also be a DXdao governance token that manages the DXdao on-chain treasury.

Recently launched and airdropped to aligned communities, <a href="https://medium.com/swapr/announcing-swpr-token-e8ab12dbad45" target="_blank">SWPR</a> is the governance token for the Swapr AMM protocol. 

DXdao is fully on-chain and minimizes its reliance on third-parties, controlling its products through ENS, and managing the treasury through binding, on-chain votes. DXdao aims to bring decentralization to DeFi and build resilient financial services for the world.
