# Getting Started

  Delta is an exchange for trading of cryptocurrency derivatives. We currently offer Futures contracts on bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). The following features stand us apart from other cryptocurrency exchanges:

-   **Leverage:** All derivative contracts traded on Delta have built in leverage of up to $100$x. This means that with say $100 worth of BTC, you can take a position of size $10000.
    
-   **Speculate or manage risk:** Our futures contracts can be used to benefit from both rise or fall in cryptocurrency prices or to hedge price risk.
    
-   **BTC settlement:** Fiat currencies are not supported on Delta. This means that all the calculations of profit/ loss as well as trade settlement in done in BTC terms.
    
Once you have created your account, you need to transfer BTC to your Delta Wallet before your can start trading.

  **Making your first trade on Delta**

  The trading dashboard of Delta is comprised of multiple panels. These include chart, order book/ recent trades, order submission and open orders & position panels. The functions and uses of these panels are delineated in the picture below.

To place a trade, you need to:

-   Select the contract you are interested in
    
-   Specify the number of contracts that you are looking to buy/ sell
    
Decide on the order type (e.g. limit or market) and place it

 Once an order is placed, it will immediately show up in ‘Open Orders’ tab in the Balances panel. On execution of the order you acquire a new ‘Open position’ which displayed in the Balances panel.

 Trading derivatives is more involved and quite different from spot buying and selling of cryptocurrencies. The mechanics of margining, calculation of PnL, details of contract settlement may not be always obvious and we’d encourage you to browse through the Tutorials section as well as the rest of the documentation.

  We hope you have a happy and profitable trading experience on Delta!
