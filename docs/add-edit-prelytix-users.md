# <font color="#c54092">Add and Edit a User</font>

<div style="background: ghostwhite; font-size: 20px; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid lightgray; margin: 10px;">
  &#x1F6C8; Only Company Admins can add or edit a user. </div>

Company Admins can create and edit Company Admins and Members.

## Adding a User

When a new user is added, they will receive an email from no-reply@mrpprelytix.com to reset their temporary password. If the user does not reset their password in 14 days, they will be locked out and you will need to delete and re-add the user.

## Password Management

Once a user is created, the user can manage their password at the login screen and select "Forgot Password". An email will be sent from no-reply@mrpprelytix.com to the user to reset their password. This will include a code that they will then need to enter in the platform. The user must log in for the first time before using "Forgot Password". Using "Forgot Password" does not allow a user to get around the 14 day rule of resetting their temporary password. 

Once a user has logged in and reset their temporary password, only that user can manage and view their password in-platform.
