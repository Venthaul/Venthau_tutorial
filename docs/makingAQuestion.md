  **Note:** This section will go over how to set up the options to a multiple choice question. For other question types, please refer to the "Type Of Questions" subsection.
  <br/>

  For a multiple choice question, people can choose between a set of options and they can only select one option.
  
  It is required to have at least 1 option. To set up an option, click on "Option 1". For example, "Vanilla" is a choice to the example question.
