Twitter Standard API requires the developers to create a developer account and set up an Oauth 1.0 on your app before you can access the users' data. 
In the following steps, we walk through how we can set up our account and integrate our app with Twitter Standard API, using Oauth 1.0.
## Developer Portal
A developer account will give you access to the developer portal which lets us set up apps and the developer environment. The portal is where we ask Twitter for permission to use their API and give them the information they need, about the app.
### Applying for a developer account
Sign in with your Twitter account. If you don't have one, go to [Sign up for Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/flow/signup) to create an account.


In order to apply for a developer account, go to [Apply for a developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply).
We will choose a student account for the purposes of this tutorial.
