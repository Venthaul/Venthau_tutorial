# Other Question Types

  This section will include information for other question types. For short answer and paragraph, go to sub-section A below. For multiple choice, checkboxes and dropdown, go to sub-section B below. For linear scale, multiple choice grid, and checkbox grid, go to sub-section C

  For information on how to select a question type, go to step 2 in the "Creating And Setting Up A Question".

## A. Short Answers and Paragraph

  These question types allow people to input answers instead of choosing from pre-set options.

### Short Answers

  This option is suitable for written responses in a few words.

### Paragraph

  This option is suitable for long written responses over one or more paragraphs.

## B. Multiple Choice, Checkboxes, and Dropdown

  These question types allow people to choose from a preset list of options that you make. For steps on how to add options for this type of question, go to step 3 from the "Creating And Setting Up A Question" page.

### Multiple Choice

  This option is suitable when _only one_ option should be chosen. Add "other" option, where a person can add their own option, is available to be added.

### Checkboxes

  This option is suitable when _more than one_ option can be chosen.

### Dropdown

  This option is suitable when _only one_ option should be chosen. Add "other" option cannot be added to dropdown.

## C. Linear Scale, Multiple Choice Grid, Checkbox Grid

  These questions types are more advanced.

### 1. Linear Scale

  This option is suitable when you want your question to be rated on a scale. Your scale can start at 0 or 1, and can end on a whole number from 2 to 10. You can optionally add a label to each end of the scale to clarify how respondents should answer the question based on their opinion.

  1a. Enter your question. An example question: "How much do you like vanilla ice-cream?"

  1b. Define where your scale will start and end. Click on the little arrow on the right of the number that you want to change.

  The number on the left corresponds to the start of the scale, and the number on the right corresponds to the end.

  1c. This step is optional. Click on "label" to add a label to your scale. It is recommended to add a label so people know what each end of the scale represents. For example, 1 is hate, and 5 is love. This is what the question should look like when we preview it.

### 2. Multiple Choice Grid and Checkbox Grid

  Grid questions are a quick way to help you ask the same question for series of different items.

  In a multiple choice grid, people can select multiple answers in one spot, but only _one answer_ per row.

  Checkbox grid is similar to the multiple choice grid, except people can select _more than one answer_ per row.

#### Creating Multiple Choice Grid and Checkbox Grid Questions
  
  After selecting multiple choice grid, you screen should look like this:
  
  ![Grid](https://github.com/kevtrng/Google-Forms-Guide/blob/gh-pages/docs/images/questions/2_gridResults.png?raw=true)

  2a. Enter your question. An example question: "How much do you like each of the following ice-cream flavours?"

  2b. Click on "Row 1" to edit the first row. For additional rows, click on "Add row" to start typing. Each row represents a single item people are asked to answer for. An example of row entries following the sample question from step 2a would be "Vanilla" and "Chocolate".

  2c. Click on "Column 1" to edit the first column. For additional columns, click on "Add column" to start typing. Columns are the choices people can select from. An example to the question on step 2a would be "Hate", or "Love"
  
  A completed multiple choice grid question would look like this:

#### Additional Options

  You can add additional options to refine your grid question

  2d. Click on the three dots on the bottom right of the question for more options.
  You should see this:

##### Description

  Adding a description will help clarify your question.

  Click on "Description" following step 2d. A new area allowing you to input the description should have appeared above "Rows". 

  ![Description](https://github.com/kevtrng/Google-Forms-Guide/blob/gh-pages/docs/images/questions/2_description.png?raw=true)
  Click on "Description" to add details to your question.

##### Shuffling row order

  Click on this option to randomize the row sequence for every person.

##### Limiting response per column

  Click on this option to set a limit to one response per column. Each column may _only be selected once_ in the question. This is ideal ranking and comparing rows against each other.
