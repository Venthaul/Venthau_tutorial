# Viewing Form Results

{: .no_toc }

Congrats, you've now got your form all set up! But how do we view the results?

## 1. Click on the `Responses` Tab

Near the top of the page, you may have noticed two tabs: `Questions` and `Responses`. You may also notice a number beside `Responses`. This number indicates how many completed responses your form has received.
