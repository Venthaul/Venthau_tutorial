# UX and Design

**Purpose**

To identify the norms and practices of our UX-driven process at Countable.

**Scope**

Currently covers marketing, branding, user experience design and testing.

**Principles**
  - Meeting the needs of users is more important than tools, and processes. This is discussed in a blog [here](https://prototypr.io/post/ts-ugly-but-it-works-on-designing-for-usability)

**Background**

Countable observes the [Nielsen Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)
