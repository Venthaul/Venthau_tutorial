# Methodology Toolkit

**Purpose**

To outline our toolbox approach to methodology.

**Scope**

Covers nine specific tools and methods, as well as when to use each.

## Our Methodology Toolbox

In general, we do not take a prescriptive approach to methodology. We use methodologies as a toolbox:

* First, seek to understand the problem as deeply as possible. 
* Then, evaluate available methodologies and select those which best address the specific context for your project.

## Methodologies to Select From

Here is a guide to specific methods, and when to use each.

1.  **Scrum** - A versatile project management (PM) methodology which provides efficient change management (via backlog), regular meetings with stakeholders, continuous deployment and project velocity measurement. 
  - Use for any project with stakeholders who will be engaged throughout the project. 
  - The more and the greater variety of stakeholders, the more important a fully implemented PM methodology (Scrum) is needed.
  - See our full ops manual page on [Scrum](/operations/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT/SCRUM/).
2.  **Prototyping** - "Man plans, god laughs". Instead of planning every detail (guessing), why not build a quick approximation of your end  goal? Prototyping an excellent way to conduct and validate planning.
  - A cheap prototype lets you validate technical feasibility, market fit, usability and aesthetics without guessing (planning). 
  - Use for any novel product (different from existing ones), particularly if there may be many unknown unknowns to test for.
  - See our full ops manual page on [prototyping](/developers/PROTOTYPING/).   
3)  **Wireframes** - A lighter prototype that only includes the navigation (page structure) of your product. 
  - Use for any product with non-trivial use cases. 
  - Useful if a design process may come later and
    coding is being done first.   
4)  **Use cases** - Determine who will use the product, and how. What specific goals do users have and what steps does your product take to fulfill them?   
5)  **User Stories** - A variation on Use Cases, and part of Scrum. Emphasizes a deep understanding of the Actor's point of view and context.
  - Use for any new project that involves developing a product.
  - See our full ops manual page on [User Stories](USER_STORIES.md).
6)  **Visual Mockups** - A non-functional prototype. Displays the exact look of the finished product. 
  - Use for any public facing product.
  - Useful if wireframes or an unattractive prototype already exist, or for brand new projects.   
7)  **SEO Research** - Focused on search engines, but serves well as a general purpose market research tool. 
  - Identify what words your market uses, and the volume of searches with those words. 
  - Then, get ranked well for them. Use to understand and acquire customers.
  - See our full ops manual page on [SEO](SEO.md).
8)  **Usability testing** - Observe actual users interacting with your product, and identify obstacles and opportunities in their behaviour. 
  - Use on workflows you need the user to complete reliably.
  - See our full ops manual page on [usability testing](USABILITY_TESTING.md).
9)  **Creative brief** - A lightweight design process kick-off document to identify the project goal, audience, proposed tone/character, and summarize design deliverables. 
  - Use before undertaking substantial creative/branding work.
  - See our full ops manual page giving an example of a [creative brief](CREATIVE_BRIEF.md).
