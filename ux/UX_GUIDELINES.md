# UX and Design Guidelines

**Purpose**

Provides the Countable team with guidelines for when our work intersects with the UX domain.

**Scope**

This document currently sets guidelines for usability, content writing, publishing on social media, and SEO.

## Usability

Company-wide usability standards and guidelines, so we maintain a minimum bar for our work and clients' work.

### Guidelines

  - Body text should be 16px or larger.
  - The body text font stack should fall back to Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif.

### User Interfaces

We should curate our own knowledge here. For now visit: [Good UI](https://goodui.org/).
