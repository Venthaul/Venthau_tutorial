**Purpose**

A guide to getting started Wireframing effectively

**Scope**

Gives guidelines to get more information out the wireframing process.

## Guidelines

Before Wireframing you should:
  * Undertake a discovery process to determine the main problem your product will solve.
  * Complete User Stories (Clarify who uses the product, to accomplish what, and why they would do so)
  * Have Information Architecture (List of the different views and how the user navigates between them)
  * Look at similar products you or others worked on before, to glean what UI patterns work well for your problem domain.
  * Understrand the Business Process Flow or User Journey (what steps does the user take in sequence?)

The Wireframe serves as a way to consolidate all the information above and make it digestible for stakeholders.

Your wireframe should:
  * Show the full navigation of the app in at least one of your views, even if you are designing just a small section of UI inside that.
  * Group components by task relatedness to minimize the user "jumping around" (visual heirarchy)
  * Make it clear how the user accomplishes the User Stories, and the order of interactions.
  * Make it clear what task the user is doing in each view. (editing, viewing information, navigating)
