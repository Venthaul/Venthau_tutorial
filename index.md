# Countable Web's Open Source Ops Manual

## What Is This?

This is the [Countable Web Productions Inc.](http://countable.ca)
*operations manual*. It's a living record of how our company works, and
is constantly evolving as we learn. Our whole team proposes amendments
in order to constantly improve the material here.

Like for an open source software project, our processes and other
information assets are publicly available for anyone to use under the
MIT license. *However*, just as an open source software project does not
disclose its database contents, this repository does not include any of
our clients' and employees' private data.

## Purpose

*First, why does this repository exist?* The purpose of this repository
is simply as a record of what worked well in the past and what to avoid. In some cases, we may reference outside resources but primarily this is a living record of what our company has learned.

In some (rare) cases, we may document exact processes{: .label .label-purple } that must be followed but in general this manual is intended as a guide to help improve individual and team performance by sharing what works, and documenting conventions so we can coordinate better.

In the words of "The Great CEO Within", By Matt Mochary:

> Whenever you find yourself saying something for a second time (to a
> second audience, or in a second situation), it is highly likely that
> you will end up saying it again and again in the future. To vastly
> improve the quality of the communication, and reduce the amount of
> time that you spend communicating it â€¦ write it down.  
> Then, the next time you need to communicate that message, you can
> simply share it in written form. If it is something that all members
> of the team should know and remember, put it in a company-wide Wiki.
> If it is truly seminal to the organization, post it on a wall for all
> to see.

*Second, why is it open source?* To promote [transparency](philosophy/TRANSPARENCY/).

## Scope

This repo will contain:

CONVENTIONS
{: .label .label-blue } 

PROCESSES
{: .label .label-purple } 

  - Guidelines based on what worked well (or poorly) for us in the past.
  - Conventions in order to help us communicate and collaborate efficiently.
  - Processes which should be carefully followed, unless you have a good reason not to.
  - The Articles of Incorporation and other general corporate documents.
    Countable is a
    [CCPC](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/type-corporation.html#ccpc),
    but it's possible some of these documents may be useful for other
    organization structures.
  - We will *not* publish information here that would compromise the
    privacy or property of our employees, clients or customers. For
    example, *filled* timesheets, invoices and other documents with
    monetary specifics of other parties will not be filed here. For
    these, only empty templates will be provided.

## What is Countable?

Countable is a Web Technology Solutions Development Firm. We build
things with web technology. There are tens of thousands of companies
that do this. What makes us different?

  - We are obsessed with feedback. A remote team, feedback loops are
    harder to establish and even more critical to our ability to deliver
    great work. At Countable, feedback is sacred, and everyone is
    encouraged to maximize thoughtful feedback to one another as much as
    possible. We want our clients to see our work as we're doing it and
    be as visible as possible.
  - We're built to address the 3 main failure modes of software projects
    (over budget, overdue, and incorrect requirements). We do this by
    prototyping (the art of simulating an experience with the minimum
    effort).
  - We work hard to be transparent, interactive, and have fun.

## Who is Countable?

We are selective in order to embody our [values](philosophy/VALUES/).
This starts with hiring, all the way to the kinds of partners we seek
out. In the end, we want to bring together people to have a big impact
by improving all the industries we engage with, through better
technology designed by the end users themselves. Those users are the
ones who understand their problems and need to given a voice to control
the technology they depend on. Now that's a feedback loop\!

If you want to suggest a change to Countable Web Productions, make a
pull request. The rules:

  - *Important*: Never commit private data or protected intellectual
    property. Nothing specific to our employees, clients, or finances
    should go in here.
  - Organize by "context". The documents in here are intended to be
    actionable. So, for any document, place it with a name and folder
    structure that matches what someone is *doing when they need this
    information*. For example, a timesheet template should go in the
    GETTING\_STARTED folder, since it will be used by new employees.
  - Link prolifically. Wherever you can, link words of your pages to
    other pages or other websites.
  - Keep it concise, to-the-point, actionable. If you do use an
    abstraction, provide a corresponding example.
  - Each page should state it's purpose for existing, as related to the
    company's [mission](philosophy/PHILOSOPHY/). Clarity and
    utility over completeness. Try to maximize "usefulness density", or
    the total benefit (ie, in saved time, dollars) of the content
    divided by its length (in characters).
  - This repository is intended for a specific company (Countable Web
    Productions Inc.), if you want to use it for another company, please
    fork it.
