# Hi, I'm Wesley.

### About

I am a research professional at the intersection of neuroscience, computation, and language.

I was most recently a research engineer at [Halo Neuroscience](https://haloneuro.com) in San Francisco. There, I used a combination of behavioral and neuroimaging methods to study the effects of transcranial electrical stimulation on human performance. Before that, I graduated from New York University with a BS in Neuroscience.

I am from the island nation of [Singapore](https://www.tripzilla.com/singapore-worlds-best-city-for-street-food/).
