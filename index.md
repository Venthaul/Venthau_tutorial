# AudioArchive

Welcome to AudioArchive Docs! AudioArchive is a free and easy way to get free music, ebooks and audiobooks.
All Audio and EPUB Files are Licensed by [Ram Tech v1](https://ariestropixdev.github.io/audioarchive/docs/LICENSE/).

### Why AudioArchive?

Because AudioArchive uses Google Play Music and Youtube to Mp3 Converters to get our music for other people (paid or free).
And then its accessable to you!

### Who created AudioArchive?

[AriesTropixDev](https://github.com/AriesTropixDev) made all of this happen! Without him, there would be no such thing as
AudioArchive.

### What happened to Lockfile?

I had something better instead of Lockfile! You are looking at its docs right now!ðŸ˜‰
