# Processes

**Purpose**

To anchor all of the replicable processes, checklists, and recommended practices that will keep Countable running smoothly.

**Scope**

Currently this page primarily links out to other existing pages with important procedural information to revisit regularly, as well as a few nested sets of related processes (Onboarding, Evaluation, and Recruiting).

You will see the following label applied to pages and content which refer to specific processes we've developed for working at Countable:
PROCESS
{: .label .label-purple }

# Onboarding Guide

New hires should start with our [Onboarding Guide](/processes/onboarding/ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md), and pose any questions that come up in the \#operations channel in Slack!

# Evaluation Process

Twice a year, our team members conduct a self-evaluation process and discuss it with their direct manager. The information on that process is available [here](/processes/evaluation/EVALUATION.md).

# Other Useful Process Pages

So far, we've identified useful "revisits" for team members (and opportunities to update these pages as needed) in the following pages:

* [End of Month Checklist](EOM.md)
* [Making Decisions](MAKING_DECISIONS.md)
* [Feedback Loops](FEEDBACK_LOOPS.md)
* [Process Experiments](PROCESS_EXPERIMENTS.md)

# Recruiting

While our recruiting steps only need to be replicated by a small amount of team members in the hiring process, we consider it best practices to remain transparent and consistent. Our [Recruiting documents start here](/processes/recruiting/RECRUITING.md).
