## Collaborating Together

  Before writing this guide, we had team meetings on Discord and Zoom to brainstorm for a topic that would help the general public. After deciding on writing a beginners guide to Google Forms, we discussed and documented the necessary requirements to complete this guide.
  
  Due to the continued impact of COVID-19 on social restrictions, we have been accustomed to collaborating remotely. All progress and obstacles were communicated with each other via Discord.
 
## Creating This Guide

  To write this guide, we had to use existing skills as well as learn new skills.
