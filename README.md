<hr>


## Overview

This repository holds a small instructional guide on how to use Google Forms. It is intended to provide a beginner with a general understanding of how to create and set up a Google Form.

By the end of this guide, you should understand how to:
- create a google form
- set up questions and answers
- organize questions into sections
- view results, and
- customize a google form

This documentation was built using [Just the Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs)

## Collaborating Together

Before writing this guide, we had team meetings on Discord and Zoom to brainstorm for a topic that would help the general public. We considered factors such as our knowledge level, the intended audience, and scope of our guide. After deciding on writing a beginners guide to Google Forms, we discussed and documented the requirements to complete this guide.

Due to the continued impact of COVID-19 on social restrictions, we have been accustomed to collaborating remotely. All progress and obstacles were communicated with each other via Discord.

## Creating This Guide

To write this guide, we were forced to learn new skills and use them with our existing abilities. None of us had previous experience writing documentation or content meant for web users. Learning how to use markdown and Github pages were also rather unfamiliar to us.

For the styling and visuals, we used This documentation was built using Patrick Marsceill[Just the Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) as a base, and configured it to our needs.

### Using Markdown

Prior to writing this guide, each of us had minimal experience using markdown. We learnt how to format documents with the use of headings, lists, links, and more. Properly formatting a page proved to be useful as it gave our documentation a polished structure and would allow future users to read with ease.

### Writing for the Web

Unlike academic papers, writing web content is drastically different. We had to take time to think from a user's perspective and break our ideas into small, clear instructions. We consciously avoided using larger vocabulary to keep our instructions simple as possible.

We also used the Inverted Pyramid style of writing, which delivers the most crucial information to the reader first. Using this method helps readers skim our instructions quickly and allows them to decide if they would like to read into further detail of a section.

### Issues We Ran into

During the writing process, we came across several issues. Some were a bit minor, such as accidentally merging with the wrong GitHub branch.

Larger issues we ran into were related to formatting. Our icons would sometimes be an awkward size, or our paragraphs would display as a block of code. However, these problems were solved after a quick Google search or asking our more experienced peers.

A major issue that we faced was deciding on the best way to structure our writing. We had clashing views on what sections were big enough to have their own pages and such. These conflicts were resolved over a group meeting.

### Conclusion

Overall, this project was an enjoyable and valuable experience. Even though using Google Forms for us is easy, we found it surprisingly difficult to write instructions in a manner that could be easily read by our intended audience.

Working as a group provided different insights and gave us a wider range of options when making decisions. It also forced us to break up the workload evenly and further develop our leadership and teamwork skills.
