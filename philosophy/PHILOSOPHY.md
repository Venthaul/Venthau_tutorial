# Philosophy

**Purpose**

To provide a foundation for all we do at Countable (processes) rooted in why we do it (philosophy).

**Scope**

Covers our company's purpose, vision, values, and principles, as well as
covering our philosophies on transparency and management. We also
provide references at the end that have influenced these philosophies.

## Basics of Our Purpose at Countable

At the most abstract level, we want to solve the problem of information
context. With more data available than ever, the problem becomes getting
the right data at the right time.

To be less abstract, this typically manifests as:

  - Fixing feedback loops. Giving all stakeholders the right information
    at the right time to optimize decision making.
  - Put relevant data at users' fingertips to enable automation and
    effective, efficient workflows.

Examples of how we embody this purpose:

  - *Better Customer Journey Systems* - Improve customer experiences
    using web technology. With faster feedback loops via prototyping,
    Scrum and tools which improve transparency.
  - *Easier 3rd Party Web Components*: Website Owners should be able to
    install and manage their website from a single place, instead of
    having to find and manage many 3rd party component management
    dashboards.

The purpose statement also says a lot by what's left out. It helps us
work towards the same goals as a team, and helps new clients and
colleagues decide if we're a good fit. We should refer to this mission
to justify our projects and other pages of this manual.

Lesser purposes of the organization.

  - Provide an exciting, motivating place to work well, and on things we
    believe in.
  - Provide an environment optimized for learning quickly.
  - Continuously improve in how we approach our work.
